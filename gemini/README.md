# Gemini

## Description

A simple interface configuration script for Kali Linux built around the flexibility of dconf-editor.

## Installation

The following script will automatically apply the configs to your system.

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Perdyx/gemini/master/install.sh > geminstall && \
  chmod 755 geminstall && \
  sudo ./geminstall && \
  rm geminstall
```

If the installer does not work, you can manually execute `sudo ./install.sh` from within the repository.
